## üì§ Step 1: Upload Policy Documents

### Upload via cURL
```bash
# Upload a PDF insurance policy
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/documents/upload" \
     -F "file=@insurance_policy.pdf" \
     -F "document_type=insurance" \
     -F "category=health_insurance" \
     -F "title=Corporate Health Insurance Policy 2024"

# Upload an HR policy document
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/documents/upload" \
     -F "file=@employee_handbook.docx" \
     -F "document_type=hr" \
     -F "category=policies" \
     -F "title=Employee Handbook"

# Upload a legal contract
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/documents/upload" \
     -F "file=@service_agreement.pdf" \
     -F "document_type=legal" \
     -F "category=contracts"
```

### Upload via Python
```python
import requests

# Upload insurance policy
with open('insurance_policy.pdf', 'rb') as f:
    files = {'file': f}
    data = {
        'document_type': 'insurance',
        'category': 'health_insurance',
        'title': 'Corporate Health Insurance Policy 2024'
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        'http://localhost:8000/documents/upload',
        files=files,
        data=data
    )
    
    result = response.json()
    print(f"Document uploaded: {result['document_id']}")
    print(f"Processing time: {result['processing_time']:.2f}s")
    print(f"Text chunks created: {result['chunk_count']}")
```

### Expected Upload Response
```json
{
  "document_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "filename": "insurance_policy.pdf",
  "document_type": "insurance",
  "category": "health_insurance",
  "text_length": 15420,
  "chunk_count": 23,
  "embeddings_created": 23,
  "processing_time": 12.45,
  "status": "completed",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## üìã Step 2: Manage Documents

### List All Documents
```bash
# Get all documents
curl "http://localhost:8000/documents"

# Filter by document type
curl "http://localhost:8000/documents?document_type=insurance"

# Filter by category
curl "http://localhost:8000/documents?category=health_insurance"

# Paginate results
curl "http://localhost:8000/documents?page=1&page_size=5"
```

### Check Document Status
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/documents/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
```

### Delete Document (if needed)
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/documents/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
```

## üîç Step 3: Query Your Documents

Now that your documents are processed and indexed, you can ask questions!

### Basic Queries via cURL
```bash
# Insurance coverage query
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": "Does this insurance policy cover knee surgery?"
     }'

# HR policy query
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": "What is the vacation policy for new employees?"
     }'

# Legal contract query
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": "What are the termination conditions in this contract?"
     }'
```

### Advanced Queries via Python
```python
import requests

def query_documents(question):
    response = requests.post(
        'http://localhost:8000/query',
        json={'query': question}
    )
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        result = response.json()
        print(f"Question: {question}")
        print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
        print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
        print(f"Supporting Evidence:")
        
        for i, clause in enumerate(result['supporting_clauses'], 1):
            print(f"  {i}. {clause['text'][:100]}...")
            print(f"     (Document: {clause['document_id']}, Score: {clause['confidence_score']:.2f})")
        
        print(f"Explanation: {result['explanation']}")
        print("-" * 80)
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.json()}")

# Example queries
queries = [
    "What medical procedures are covered under this policy?",
    "Are pre-existing conditions covered?",
    "What is the maximum coverage limit?",
    "How do I file a claim?",
    "What are the exclusions in this policy?",
    "Is mental health treatment covered?",
    "What is the deductible amount?",
    "Are prescription drugs covered?"
]

for query in queries:
    query_documents(query)
```

## üìä Expected Query Response

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Document Upload Failures**

   curl "http://localhost:8000/health"
   
   # Verify file size (< 50MB recommended)
   ls -lh your_document.pdf
   ```

2. **No Search Results**
   ```bash
   # Verify document was processed
   curl "http://localhost:8000/documents"
   
   # Check document status
   curl "http://localhost:8000/documents/{document_id}"
   ```

3. **Poor Answer Quality**
